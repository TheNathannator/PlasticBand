# iOS Guitar Hero Live Guitars

## Device Info

- Vendor/product ID: Unknown
- Revision:
- Device name: `Ble Guitar`
- Bluetooth LE GATT characteristic UUID: `533E1524-3ABE-F33F-CD00-594E8B0A8EA3`

## Input Info

The information here is based on how things are handled in GHLtarUtility.

The iOS guitar is a Bluetooth LE device, and input data must be retrieved from the GATT characteristic listed above. While the report is structured identically to that of the PS3/Wii U GHL guitar, the report length appears to be shorter, based on the comments in GHLtarUtility. The code doesn't confirm this though, as the length of the buffer to read the data isn't hardcoded, unlike how it handles other devices.

---

The d-pad works as normal, with the exception that it is neutral at 15 (`0x0F`) instead of 8.

Frets:

| Fret    | Button |
| :---    | :---:  |
| Black 1 | ×      |
| Black 2 | ○      |
| Black 3 | Δ      |
| White 1 | □      |
| White 2 | L1     |
| White 3 | R1     |

Strumbar: Left stick Y

- `0x80` when not pressed, `0x00` when strumming up, `0xFF` when strumming down.

Whammy: Right stick Y

- Ranges from `0x80` when not pressed to `0xFF` when fully pressed. (Assumed based on other GHL guitars)

Tilt: Accelerometer X

D-pad center button: PlayStation button

Pause buttons: Start button

Hero Power button: Select button

GHTV button: L3
