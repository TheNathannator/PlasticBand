# PlasticBand

A repository of documentation on how to interface with and interpret the input data of the Rock Band and Guitar Hero peripherals.

## Plans

This may evolve into an actual library, it's something I've wanted to do for quite some time! For now though, the scope is limited to simply information. However, I *am* creating a Unity package to add support for everything to the Unity InputSystem package: https://github.com/TheNathannator/PlasticBand-Unity
